        <h5>
          A Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) is a type of chronic disease that occurs in modern people’s behavior. Patients have to take care of themselves by having regular health checkups and avoid risks. At Kokha hospital, doctor will provide record book for the patient to keep personal health record of each checkup. However, as time passes, some patient loses their book-recording or the book is deteriorated. Due to this reason, the doctor will not be able to view the overall history of the patient’s health problems as this may lead to inconsistency treatment.
        </h5><br />
        <h5>
          Personal E-Health System for Long-Term Non-Communicable Disease Care(PEHS) is a web application which retrieves the data from HOSxP for the doctor. Therefore, the doctor can see the recorded history of the patient and treat the patient more precisely. Besides that, the doctor also can record patient’s health information into the database. Thus, this allows the doctor to track the patient continuously. PEHS is also a mobile application for the patient to receive clear visualization whether blood-test results are normal and estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease.
